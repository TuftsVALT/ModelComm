# ModelComm

This repository contains all supplemental material for our TVCG submission, titled "Are Metrics Enough? Guidelines for Communicating and Visualizing Predictive Models to Subject Matter Experts."

A preprint of our paper is included in the parent directory.

The slides presented to data scientists & SMEs for both interview studies can be found in their respective folders. Consent forms, demographic surveys, and recruitment emails are included. Our codebook, thematic analysis procedure, and boxplot for code frequency can be found in first_interview_study/analysis/.

The slides for our second interview study ("follow-up study" / "demonstration of the guidelines") include both scenarios presented to SMEs: the first scenario without the use of our guidelines, and the second scenario with the use of our guidelines. The visualizations, annotations, and additional model information (e.g., data descriptors, metric definitions, etc.) used in our demonstration can be found in the second half of the slide deck. The interactive notebook for all visualizations are open source at https://observablehq.com/@ashleysuh/model-comm-vis. 

If you have questions about any of these materials, feel free to contact Ashley Suh (ashley . suh _at_ tufts . edu).
